To install PostgreSQL, set the password for the postgres user (which is the default superuser), and log in to PostgreSQL, follow the steps below.


1. Install PostgreSQL
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


2. Set Password for the postgres User

By default, PostgreSQL uses the postgres user for database administration. To set the password for the postgres user:
  sudo -u postgres psql
Once you are in the PostgreSQL shell, run the following command to change the password: 
  ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
Replace your_password with the password you want to set for the postgres user.

3. Exit the PostgreSQL Shell by typing:
\q

4. Log in with the postgres User: 
To log in to PostgreSQL with the new password, you can run the following command:
  psql -U postgres -W
The -U flag specifies the username (postgres in this case), and -W prompts you to enter the password. You will be prompted to enter the password you just set.

5. Verify the Installation and Connection, Once logged in, you can verify the connection and database by running:
  \l
