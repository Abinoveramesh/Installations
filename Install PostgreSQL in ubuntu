To install PostgreSQL, set the password for the postgres user (which is the default superuser), and log in to PostgreSQL, follow the steps below.


1. Install PostgreSQL
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib


2. Set Password for the postgres User

By default, PostgreSQL uses the postgres user for database administration. To set the password for the postgres user:
  sudo -u postgres psql
Once you are in the PostgreSQL shell, run the following command to change the password: 
  ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
Replace your_password with the password you want to set for the postgres user.

3. Exit the PostgreSQL Shell by typing:
\q

4. Log in with the postgres User: 
To log in to PostgreSQL with the new password, you can run the following command:
  psql -U postgres -W
The -U flag specifies the username (postgres in this case), and -W prompts you to enter the password. You will be prompted to enter the password you just set.

5. Verify the Installation and Connection, Once logged in, you can verify the connection and database by running:
  \l




#To see status:
sudo systemctl status postgresql

#Login
sudo su - postgres
psql

#login other user
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U usertravelfrc -d traveldevelopmet -p 5432

#To change this postgres password:
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'root';

#To create a root user:
CREATE ROLE root WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN PASSWORD 'root';

#To create a user with certain access:

#Grant the testuser permissions to read from and write to the testerdb database:
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE testerdb TO testuser;

#Switch to the testerdb database to grant permissions on all tables:
\c testerdb

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO testuser;
#Then grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE permissions on all current tables:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;

#To ensure testuser gets permissions on any future tables created in the public schema, execute:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO testuser;
\q
