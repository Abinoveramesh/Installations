A Handy Guide to Maven Commands 🚀💡 Mastering Maven for Java Projects. Maven is an essential tool for Java developers, streamlining project builds, dependency management, and much more.
Here's a quick reference to key Maven commands to level up your productivity! 🔧


🛠 1. Project Management Commands
mvn clean: Cleans the project (deletes the target directory).
mvn compile: Compiles the source code.
mvn test: Runs tests configured in the project.
mvn package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
mvn install: Installs the package into the local repository for reuse.
mvn deploy: Deploys the built package to a remote repository.

📦 2. Dependency Management
mvn dependency:resolve: Resolves all project dependencies.
mvn dependency:tree: Displays the dependency tree.
mvn dependency:analyze: Optimizes dependencies by analyzing unused ones.
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository: Clears specific artifacts from the local repository.

🔄 3. Lifecycle Commands
mvn validate: Validates project structure and pom.xml.
mvn verify: Runs integration tests.
mvn site: Generates project documentation and reports.

⚙️ 4. Plugins and Goals
mvn help:describe -Dplugin=<plugin>: Describes a plugin and its goals.
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=<main>: Runs a specified main class.
mvn install:install-file: Installs an external JAR into the local repository.

🚀 5. Run Specific Profiles
mvn -P<profile>: Activates a specific profile.
mvn package -P<profile>: Builds the project using a profile.

✅ 6. Skip Tests
mvn install -DskipTests: Skips test execution.
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true: Skips both test compilation and execution.

🕵️ 7. Debugging
mvn -X: Enables debug output.
mvn -e: Shows detailed error logs.

🔄 8. Updating Dependencies
mvn dependency:resolve -U: Updates dependencies from remote repositories.
📂 9. Generate Archetypes
mvn archetype:generate: Creates a project from a Maven template.

🔢 10. Versioning
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<ver>: Updates project version.
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates: Lists updates for dependencies.

🌟 Examples
Clean and Build: mvn clean install
Run a Java Class: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
Skip Tests and Package: mvn package -DskipTests
