How to Create a 4GB Swap File on Your EC2 Instance
Check existing swap (optional):
sudo swapon --show
free -h

Create a swap file of 4GB:
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
If fallocate is unavailable, use:
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096

Set the correct permissions for security:
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

Format the file as swap space:
sudo mkswap /swapfile

Enable the swap file immediately:
sudo swapon /swapfile

Verify that swap is active:
sudo swapon --show
free -h

Make swap permanent (auto-enable on reboot):


Open the fstab file: 
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add this line at the end:
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

A Small Reminder
Swap can help with memory pressure, but it's not a substitute for RAM â€” so if possible, plan for a future instance upgrade if you frequently hit memory limits.
